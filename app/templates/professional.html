### Late Penalty

If I have not completed the last milestone by the end of {{ g.timeframe.development.units }} {{ g.timeframe.development.period }}, I will deduct {{ g.timeframe.development.unit_penalty }} {{ g.currency }} from the total amount owed for each additional {{ g.timeframe.development.units }} it takes to complete the milestone (up to a maximum of {{ g.timeframe.development.max_penalty }} {{ g.currency }}). This does not include delays caused by late payments or time spent waiting for you to deliver requested data or information.

### Project Fee Calculation

The final fee will be a total of the estimate and accrued pre-approved project expenses minus late penalty (if any). Add-ons are billed in 15 minute increments and have a 1 hour minimum. The amount due on the final invoice will be the final fee minus all previous payments.
